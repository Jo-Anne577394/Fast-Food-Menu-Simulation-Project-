# Fast-Food-Menu-Simulation-Project

This project involves the development of a C# console application simulating a fast-food restaurant menu. 
The application utilizes Enum-driven menus for various food and drink categories, allowing users to order products, track their orders and costs, and check out. 
Key requirements include implementing Enum menus, methods for menu generation, order tracking, and checkout functionality. 
The application features a looping mechanism for continuous use and offers the option to close the application.
